# NinjaScript V12 Project Standards

- **Language**: C# 8.0 / .NET Framework 4.8 (NinjaTrader 8).
- **Concurrency**: All state mutations (activePositions, expectedPositions) MUST be guarded by lock(stateLock).
- **Lifecycle**: Semaphores (_simaToggleSem) MUST be released in finally blocks.
- **Refactoring**: Prefer explicit FirstOrDefault logic for instrument lookups (Reaper parity).
- **Style**: Use PascalCase for methods, camelCase for local variables. Avoid dense one-liners; prioritize "Metabolic Elegance."

## 🛡️ Protocol Hardening (V12.Phase7)

### 1. Scope Control
- **Surgical Edits**: AI agents MUST restrict code modifications to the specific files requested in the Mission Brief. NEVER refactor unrelated files without explicit Director authorization.
- **Zero-Trust Planning**: Always generate an `implementation_plan.md` before applying code changes to local files.

### 2. WPF/UI Guardrails
- **Escalation**: If a UI layout or positioning task enters a loop (more than 2 failed attempts), the agent MUST halt and escalate to the Director for manual layout review.
- **Headless Mode**: Prefer headless execution for batch logic updates; do not attempt complex UI re-styling without a visual brief.

### 3. Path & Deployment Management
- **Source Truth**: All primary NinjaScript logic resides in `src/`.
- **Deployment**: Local builds MUST be synced to `C:\Users\Mohammed Khalid\Documents\NinjaTrader 8\bin\Custom\Strategies\` using the `./deploy-sync.ps1` script (or `/deploy` skill).

## 🏁 Environment Truths (NinjaScript/NT8)

- **Execution Context**: Codes executes in NinjaTrader 8. `Print()` outputs ONLY to the NT8 UI Output Window, not to local logs on disk.
- **Built-in Indicators**: Managed by the NT8 installer; DO NOT attempt to modify or fix built-in indicator files via code.
- **WPF Layouts**: Chart Trader panels REQUIRE hard-coded pixel widths. Do NOT attempt relative layouts (Star, Stretch) as they fail in the injected window context.
- **Large Files**: For `.cs` files >500 lines, use `grep` and chunked reads. Never attempt to replace the entire file content.

## ⚛️ Atomic Session Protocol

- **One Patch Per Session**: Apply only one major patch (e.g., 1102Q) per AI session.
- **Regression Audit**: Every patch MUST be followed by a `/audit` command to check for downstream side-effects before declaring completion.
- **Scope Discipline**: Confirm the exact file list before editing. NEVER expand scope to configs/docs unless explicitly instructed.

## 🕹️ Director Commands ($)

- **$PLAN_AUDIT**: Use `read_terminal` on the active Claude/Antigravity PID to ingest Sonnet's implementation plan. Perform a forensic logic audit before recommending approval to the Director.
- **$MISSION**: Initialize a new project phase via a Mission Brief artifact.
- **$AUDIT**: Trigger the `/audit` skill to scan the `src/` directory.

## Agent Synchronization
AI Agents (Anthropic, Codex, Antigravity, Cursor, Gemini) MUST follow the **[.agent/standards_manifesto.md](file:///.agent/standards_manifesto.md)** as the primary source of truth for architectural standards and safety protocols.
